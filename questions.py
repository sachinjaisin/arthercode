Important Instructions:

* Generate ONLY the next question based on the user's last answer.
* Strictly follow the exact output format above (Question Type, Question, Question Hint, etc.).
* Do NOT include anything outside of this format (no extra text or commentary).
* Ensure the question text is not more than 48 characters (the hint can be longer).
* Ensure all five question types are used at least once across the 12 sequential questions.
* Ensure each question is a complete sentance on it own which is easily understood by a normal person
Plan a 12-question sequence to fully understand the user's risk profile, adapting each question to previous answers. Keep it engaging.
